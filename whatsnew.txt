============

General:
- new: now using CVS source control system. This is making development much much easier! :)

Core:
- fix: fixed I/O port decoding for RAM configuration PAL inside CPC6128; and for PAL integrated
  into CPC+ ASIC. Thankyou to Richard Wilson for his help.
- fix: fixed a bug in the RAM configuration which prevented Overflow's Backtro and C/PM+ from running.
- fix: sample loading: 16-bit samples were treated as unsigned, but they are 
  actually signed. fixed.
- fix: lots of fdc emulation bugs fixed
- fix: lots of bugs fixed in disc image output code; applies to inserting unformatted discs; 
  a lot of created images were bad!
  strange formats are mostly supported now.
- fix: write deleted data now marks sectors with deleted data control mark now!
- fix: all fdc commands supported including scan commands
- fix: multi-track function of fdc fully implemented
- new: support for DIF disk image (used by CPC++ emulator) [Richard Bannister]
- new: seperated floppy disc controller, floppy disc drive, and floppy disc interface code.
- fix: fixed decoding of disc controller I/O ports
- new: removed as many references to Host_LoadFile and Host_SaveFile from the core code.
(this allows the host to supply binary data which is included in executable, and allows
the host to use it's own load/save functions). 
- new: updated the load and save functions to return status code's which indicate an errors
(this allows the host code to return more meaningful error code's and messages;
or to even log them to a file)
- new: removed reference to Host_OpenFile and Host_CloseFile functions from printer code.
The host must now handle the printer output itself.
- new: removed cpcdefs.h file. Defines are build related and should be defined in the project/makefile for each port.
- new: auto-type helper feature; enter the text you want to type in and let the auto-type
feature do all the hard work for you :) Thankyou to Troels K for the first version which
he has in CPC Explorer/CPC Loader.
- new: auto-start helper feature; this feature will attempt to auto-start any image that
has been inserted. But, on the CPC there can be more than one way to run a program,
so this feature may not work with all discs. Try it and see :)

General interface functions:
- merged tape-image and sample handling code

CPC:
- fix: fixed keyboard problems in CPC mode.

CPC+:
- fix: fixed mirror of sprite X,Y coordinates in magnification registers
- fix: fixed sprite coordinates bugs. Simply the Best and Iron demo 3 will display exactly
  as on a real CPC+.

Windows version

Lots of user interface stuff to make Arnold easier to use :)
- new: roms moved to source distribution. Rom data is now built into executable.
- new: roms are integrated into executable. [Troels K, Andreas M, Richard B, Kev T]
- new: command-line supported; you can run arnold from the command line with various parameters.
- new: you can double click on a file to automatically launch Arnold (you must register the file
types first)
- new: you can drag and drop a file onto the Arnold window/exe and it will
  automatically be inserted
- new: you can double click on a file while Arnold is open, and it will be opened in Arnold.
- new: will detect if another instance of the application is running; you can choose to open
file with existing instance or new instance
- new: now using Zlib libary for decompression of ZIP archives. (some old files compressed with PKZIP may
not open; this is a limitation of the Zlib library) [Troels K, Kev T]
- new: executable compressed using UPX [Troels K]
- new: implemented file selection dialog for ZIP archives.
- new: zip archives now supported by all media (cassette, disc, cartridge, snapshot etc)
- fix: rom versions were not always displayed. Now fixed.
- new: lots of changes for UNICODE version of Arnold. [Troels K]
- new: unicode support for zlib [Troels K]
- new: build instructions for windows version
- new: About dialog box giving some copyright, logo and version information
- new: manifest file used to enable new look under Windows XP.
- new: you can associate the files of your choice with Arnold. Or if you want to keep your
current associations, then you can open the files using "Open with Arnold" from the shell.
- new: merged "Open Sample" and "Open Tape Image" into a single "Open Tape" menu item.
- new: "recent files" menu
- inserting a unformatted disc and selecting a existing file will now ask if you want
  to overwrite.


27-January-2002
---------------

Core:
- fixed a bug in the AY-3-8912 I/O port handlers. Now emulated exactly like the hardware. Thankyou
to Russell Marks for his discoveries about the AY-3-8912 I/O port operation. [Russell Marks, Kevin Thacker]

Windows
- changed resource file so it could compile if MFC was not installed with Visual studio
- changed makefile.w32 so resources can be compiled with MingW

Linux:
- incorporates latest changes from Andreas Micklei (see whatsnew.linux for more details)


21-October-2001
===============

Core:
- fixed a bug in rendering. Buffer could be overrun. Fixes problems in 15-bit display depth. [Kevin Thacker]
- fixed a bug in the tape-image code, more Speedlock v1 programs should load now. [Kevin Thacker]


20-October-2001
===============

Emulation Core:
- tape image block "0x010" was not handled correctly. fixed. [Kevin Thacker]
- first block of tape image data was always being skipped. fixed [Kevin Thacker]

Unix port:
- drive LED simulated using keyboard LEDs [Andreas Micklei]
- simple launcher (unix/launcher) [Andreas Micklei]
- start of GTK+ interface [Andreas Micklei]
- SDL version [Andreas Micklei]
- configuration script for making Arnold [Andreas Micklei]

30-September-2001
=================

- fixed graphics drawing in 24-bit and 32-bit display depths
- fixed rendering accuracy selections
- fixed snapshot loading/saving
- snapshots are more compatible with original CPCEMU file format
- added support for snapshot V3 format (as used in No$CPC) these can be read
and written now. The CPC+ chunk is not compatible with No$CPC as this does
not seem to follow the published document. V3 can be used to snapshot CPC+ programs/demos
- added snapshot command-line option to unix version
- fixed some sound bugs

02-September-2001
=================

- source release under Gnu Public License
- implemented Z80 interrupt Interrupt Mode 0 (usable in CPC+ mode)
- reverted monitor emulation back to original; no black bar down right side
- numerous fixes ("Simply the Best" demo now shows the scroller)
- provided makefile for MingW (doesn't include resources and no command-line); when I
  work out how to get the resources to compile I will add them
- provided makefile for linux/unix (may require adaption for different flavours of unix/linux)
- provided workspace and project compatible with Microsoft Visual Studio V6

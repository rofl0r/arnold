GBA version
-----------

Not yet working. Compiles and that is it.

Windows version
---------------

Using Microsoft Developer Studio or Microsoft Visual C++:

If you have Microsoft Developer Studio V6.0 or Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or newer 
then open the workspace arnold.dsp, select the appropiate configuration and then build.

Using MingW/GNU running under Windows:

If you are using MingW then you can build Arnold from the command-line using:

make -f makefile.w32

I use the mingw_for_mame.zip to setup the MingW build environment. This can be downloaded
from www.mame.net.

ZLIB:

Arnold uses the ZLIB DLL by Gilles Vollant, but is not distributed with the
build environment.

To setup Arnold to build with ZLIB DLL:

1. Download zlibxxxdll.zip (where xxx is the version number. 
   e.g. "zlib114dll.zip" ) from the ZLib DLL website 
   (http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip.html).

2. Unzip as "zlib" into the "src" folder. e.g. src folder
   is located at c:\projects\arnold\src, then after unzipping as "zlib"
   you will have c:\projects\arnold\src\zlib.

2. Copy the zlib.dll from the zlib/dll32 directory (dll32 subdirectory inside 
   the directory you unzipped zlib into).

Arnold is ready to build with ZLIB DLL :)

There are now several entry points to the dll.

There is a single "unzipping" entry point of:

windll_unzip(int ifnc, char **ifnv, int xfnc, char **xfnv,
     DCL far*lpDCL, USERFUNCTIONS far *lpUserFunc)

where the arguments are:

ifnc       = number of file names being passed. If all files are to be
             extracted, then this can be zero.
ifnv       = file names to be unarchived. Wildcard patterns are recognized
             and expanded. If all files are to be extracted, then this can
             be NULL.
xfnc       = number of "file names to be excluded from processing" being
             passed. If all files are to be extracted, set this to zero.
xfnv       = file names to be excluded from the unarchiving process. Wildcard
             characters are allowed and expanded. If all files are to be
             extracted, set this argument to NULL.
lpDCL      = pointer to a structure with the flags for setting the
             various options, as well as the zip file name.
lpUserFunc = pointer to a structure that contains pointers to functions
             in the calling application, as well as sizes passed back to
             the calling application etc. See below for a detailed description
             of all the parameters

The DCL structure is shown below:

typedef struct {
int ExtractOnlyNewer;   = true if you are to extract only newer
int SpaceToUnderscore;  = true if convert space to underscore
int PromptToOverwrite;  = true if prompt to overwrite is wanted
int fQuiet;             = quiet flag. 1 = few messages, 2 = no messages, 0 = all messages
int ncflag              = write to stdout if true
int ntflag              = test zip file
int nvflag              = verbose listing
int nUflag              = "update" (extract only newer/new files)
int nzflag              = display zip file comment
int ndflag              = all args are files/dir to be extracted
int noflag              = true if you are to always over-write files, false if not
int naflag              = do end-of-line translation
int nZIflag;            = get zip info if true
int C_flag;             = be case insensitive if TRUE
int fPrivilege          = 1 => restore Acl's, 2 => Use privileges
LPSTR lpszZipFN         = zip file name
LPSTR lpszExtractDir    = Directory to extract to. This should be NULL if you
                          are extracting to the current directory.
} DCL, _far *LPDCL;

The typedef's for the function pointers in the structure USERFUNCTIONS
are shown immediately below.

typedef unsigned short ush;
typedef int (WINAPI DLLPRNT) (LPSTR, unsigned long);
typedef int (WINAPI DLLPASSWORD) (LPSTR, int, const LPSTR, const LPSTR);
typedef void (WINAPI DLLSND) (void);
typedef int (WINAPI DLLREPLACE)(LPSTR);
typedef void (WINAPI DLLMESSAGE)(unsigned long, unsigned long,
   ush, ush, ush, ush, ush, ush, char, LPSTR, LPSTR, unsigned long, char);

Structure USERFUNCTIONS

typedef struct {
DLLPRNT *print;         = a pointer to the application's print routine.
DLLSND *sound;          = a pointer to the application's sound routine. This
                          can be NULL if your application doesn't use
                          sound.
DLLREPLACE *replace     = a pointer to the application's replace routine.
DLLPASSWORD *password   = a pointer to the application's password routine.
DLLMESSAGE *SendApplicationMessage = a pointer to the application's routine
                          for displaying information about specific files
                          in the archive. Used for listing the contents of
                          an archive.
NOTE: The values below are filled in only when listing the contents of an
      archive.

WORD cchComment;        = flag to be set if archive has a comment
unsigned long TotalSizeComp = value to be filled in by the dll for the
                          compressed total size of the archive. Note this
                          value does not include the size of the archive
                          header and central directory list.
unsigned long TotalSize = value to be filled in by the dll for the total
                          size of all files in the archive.
int CompFactor          = value to be filled in by the dll for the overall
                          compression factor. This could actually be computed
                          from the other values, but it is available.
unsigned int NumMembers = total number of files in the archive.
} USERFUNCTIONS, far * LPUSERFUNCTIONS;

For examples of how the actual calls to the dll are set up in WiZ, look in
the files action.c and wizmain.c in the WiZ source directory. For a trival
example of how to load and call the dll, look in example.c and example.h.

For examples of how the actual loading and unloading of the dll's themselves
was done, look in wizmain.c in the WiZ source directory. Note that WiZ looks
specifically for a particular version number of the dll, and also expects to
find the company name to be Info-ZIP. This is to protect from getting
different versions of the dll loaded, with resulting unknown behavior.

Additional entry points:

    WINAPI UzpVersion2(UzpVer far *);

where UzpVer is defined as:

typedef struct _UzpVer {
    ulg structlen;          /* length of the struct being passed */
    ulg flag;               /* bit 0: is_beta   bit 1: uses_zlib */
    LPSTR betalevel;        /* e.g., "g BETA" or "" */
    LPSTR date;             /* e.g., "4 Sep 95" (beta) or "4 September 1995" */
    LPSTR zlib_version;     /* e.g., "1.0.5" or NULL */
    _version_type unzip;
    _version_type zipinfo;
    _version_type os2dll;
    _version_type windll;
} UzpVer;

and _version_type is defined as:

typedef struct _ver {
    uch major;              /* e.g., integer 5 */
    uch minor;              /* e.g., 2 */
    uch patchlevel;         /* e.g., 0 */
    uch not_used;
} _version_type;

   See api.c for exactly what UzpVersion2 does, but the short version of
   what it does is fill in the version information in the UzpVer structure.

void WINAPI Unz_NoPrinting(int flag)

   This entry point simply turns off all messages to the calling application if
   flag is true, and turns them on if flag is false.

int WINAPI Unz_Validate(LPSTR archive, int AllCodes)

   If AllCodes is FALSE, then Unz_Validate returns TRUE if archive points to a
   valid archive, and FALSE otherwise. If AllCodes is TRUE, then Unz_Validate
   returns whatever error code process_zipfiles returns, without evaluating it.

int UZ_EXP UzpUnzipToMemory(char *zip, char *file, UzpBuffer *retstr)

   Where UzpBuffer is defined as:

   typedef struct _UzpBuffer {
   ulg strlength; /* length of string */
   char * strptr; /* pointer to string */
   } UzpBuffer

   Pass the name of the zip file in zip and the name of the file you wish to
   extract in file. UzpUnzipToMemory will create a buffer and return it in
   *retstr. 0 on return indicates failure.

int UZ_EXP Unz_Grep(char *zip, char *file, char * pattern, int code)

   Pass the name of the zip file in "zip", the name of the file you wish to
   perform the "grep" on in "file", and the string you wish to look for in
   "pattern". There are four possible options for code:

   0 => case insensitive search
   1 => case sensitive search
   2 => case insensitive search, whole words only
   3 => case sensitive search, whole words only

   Unz_Grep returns:

   -1 => error such as unable to allocate memory, unable to find file, etc.
    0 => match not found, based on the search criteria
    1 => match found, based on the search criteria

There is an additional function call that does not specifically deal with
"unzipping", but is a quite useful function that is currently used in Wiz
itself in several places. This call is currently only available in the
static library, not in the DLL.

Match the pattern (wildcard) against the string (fixed):

  match(string, pattern, ignore_case);

  returns TRUE if string matches pattern, FALSE otherwise.  In the pattern:

     `*' matches any sequence of characters (zero or more)
     `?' matches any single character
     [SET] matches any character in the specified set,
     [!SET] or [^SET] matches any character not in the specified set.

  A set is composed of characters or ranges; a range looks like ``character
  hyphen character'' (as in 0-9 or A-Z).  [0-9a-zA-Z_] is the minimal set of
  characters allowed in the [..] pattern construct.  Other characters are
  allowed (i.e., 8-bit characters) if your system will support them.

  To suppress the special syntactic significance of any of ``[]*?!^-\'', in-
  side or outside a [..] construct, and match the character exactly, precede
  it with a ``\'' (backslash).

The remaining functions are linked together. Their use would be as
follows (explanations for each function are shown further below):

    #include "windll.h"
    #include "structs.h"
    MyApiCallingRoutine()
    {
        CREATEGLOBALS();
        .
        .
        .
        Unz_Init(UzpGlobals, lpUserFunctions); /* Set up user functions */
        .
        .
        .
        Unz_SetOpts(UzpGlobals, lpDCL); /* Set up unzipping options */
        .
        .
        .
        Unz_Unzip(UzpGlobals, ifnc, ifnv, xfnc, xfnv); /* Unzip files */
        .
        .
        .
        DESTROYGLOBALS();
    }

Each entry point is as defined below:

    BOOL WINAPI Unz_Init(zvoid *, USERFUNCTIONS far *);

    BOOL WINAPI Unz_SetOpts(zvoid *, LPDCL);

    int WINAPI Unz_Unzip(zvoid *, int, char **, int, char **);

Note that you should use either windll_unzip OR the series of calls
described above. Using both, depending on how you do it, could cause
problems.

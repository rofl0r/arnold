You are welcome to make changes to this source, and if you do I would appreciate
it if you would send me the changes so I can incorporate them into a new source
release.

If you are compiling with Linux/Unix:

./configure
make

This has been tested with RedHat Linux v7.0. 

At the moment this version has a basic interface, but this is being
improved.

The linux/unix version is currently being maintained by Andreas Mickeli.

makefile.w32 is a makefile to be compiled with MingW/GNU tools running under Win9x/WinNT/WinME
or Win2000. (Go to http://www.mame.net/ and download mingw_for_mame.zip. Unzip this folder
and setup your path to point to the bin directory. Now make -f makefile.w32!)

arnold.dsp/arnold.dsw are the workspace and makefile to be compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio v6.0

The MacOS version is maintained by Richard Bannister. The MacOS parts of the source code
are (c) Copyright Richard Bannister and are not distributed with this source archive.
I have given Richard permission to exclude them from the archive. His source

If you make a new port to another system, I would *prefer* if you would make your source
freely available under the GNU Public License and allow me to distribute it along with
the Arnold source.

Thankyou
